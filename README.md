### Intentional Design Choices

* There is no enforcement of words you can chose. It's a party game, hold eachother accountable.

* You can guess the same letter twice. If this is annoying, be more careful.

### Game Rules

* No guessing the same player more than three times in a row, unless the number of remaining players is three or less.
